This challenge is available in the repository [java training api](https://github.com/GuillaumeFalourd/java-training-api/blob/main/DESAFIOS.md) where the goal is to implement new functions and logic to improve the API's functionality.

As the application improves, this repository will be updated to reflect the progress and changes made in the code.
